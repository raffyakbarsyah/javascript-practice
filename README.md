# 🧠 JavaScript.info Task Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to beginner-level JavaScript tasks from [JavaScript.info](https://javascript.info/). The goal is to practice using basic JavaScript constructs such as `if`, `prompt`, and ternary operators.

## ✅ Task List & Descriptions

### 1. Check the Login (Importance: 3)

**Goal**: Prompt the user for a login.

- If the input is `"Admin"` → ask for password.
  - If password is `"TheMaster"` → show `"Welcome!"`
  - If password is empty (`""`) or cancelled (`null`) → show `"Canceled"`
  - Otherwise → show `"Wrong password"`
- If login is empty or cancelled → show `"Canceled"`
- If login is anything else → show `"I don't know you"`

**Note**: This task is solved using **nested `if` statements** for better structure and readability.

### 2. The Name of JavaScript (Importance: 2)

**Prompt**: “What is the 'official' name of JavaScript?”

- If input is `"ECMAScript"` → show `"Right!"`
- Otherwise → show `"You don’t know? ECMAScript!"`

### 3. Show the Sign (Importance: 2)

**Prompt** the user for a number. Then display:

- `1` if the number is greater than zero
- `-1` if the number is less than zero
- `0` if the number is exactly zero

💡 Assumption: the input is always a valid number.

### 4. Rewrite 'if' into '?' (Importance: 5)

### 5. Rewrite 'if..else' into '?'
